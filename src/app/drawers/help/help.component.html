    Leapfire is a running application base for building responsive, serverless enterprise applications requiring
    user and account management capabilities. Leapfire can be extended with domain-specific functionality and out of
    the box comes with the following features:

    <h5>Serverless Application</h5>
    The base application is serverless in that it uses the Google Firebase/Firestore cloud database for access
    to user and account information.
    <p>
    <h5>Single Page Application</h5>
    Leapfire is a single page Angular application written in TypeScript taking advantage of Angular features
    such as routing, reactive processing, templating, Material Design, etc.
    <p>
    <h5>Responsive Design</h5>
    Leapfire employs Angular Flex-Layout to automatically format UI layouts to fit various screen sizes.
    <p>
    <h5>Modular Development</h5>
    Leapfire is designed for modular development. The Core module provides sign-in capability and basic features
    for use by other modules. The Setup module manages users and accounts as well as the relationships
    between these entities. Application-specific functionality may be implemented by creating new modules
    (or by extending existing placeholder modules).
    <p>
    <h5>Authentication</h5>
    User authentication is provided through the Firebase Java Web Token implementation. Users can sign in using
    email and password authentication and also through Auth0 identity providers, such as Google.
    <p>
    <h5>Users and Accounts</h5>
    Users and accounts have a many-to-many relationship, so that a given user may have access to one or more
    accounts and an account may have one or more users.
    <p>
    <h5>User Roles</h5>
    User permissions are governed through rules defined in the Firestore database, so that a given user may,
    for example, be assigned create, update, or read roles for accessing data collections in the database. Users
    having access to multiple accounts may be given different permissions depending on the account.
    <p>
    <h5>The Hub Account</h5>
    Only users in the special Hub account and with create permission can create new accounts. These users will
    also create the initial user for a new account. An account user with create permission can then create
    additional users for that account but for that account only.<br/><br/>
    <p>
      A user ID created from Leapfire must be a valid email address available to the intended user. Initially, a
      randomly generated, unknown password is created. The user signing in for the first time will then need to use
      the Create or Reset Password option to create a known password.

    <h5>Demo Application Sign In with Google</h5>
    First-time users signing in to the demo Leapfire application with Google will be assigned a new account named
    the same as their user ID (email address). They will also have a CREATOR role on that account.
